# Queues
#
# This example explains how to use asyncio.Queue()
#
# A first in, first out (FIFO) queue.
# If maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite. If it is an integer greater than 0, then 
# await put() blocks when the queue reaches maxsize until an item is removed by get().
